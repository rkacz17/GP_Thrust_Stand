# GP_Thrust_Stand
A code repository for the 2024-2025 Green Propellant Thrust Stand Project by Team 517 of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering. This was done in collaboration with NASA-MSFC.

## Notes regarding the code included in this repository

<ol>
  <li>When code is uploaded, the connection from the V<sub>IN</sub>, located on the arduino, should be disconnected from the rest of the power connections.</li>
  <li>There are some issues with the UI freezing during the process and subsequently not writing to the file.</li>
  <li>The arduino cannot currently process local time so attributes regarding data saved to the file should be documented elsewhere.</li>
  <li>Large amounts of noise were found in initial testing, causing the automatic zeroing to be unreliable. It is unknown, at this time, if this stems from grounding issues during testing or if more signal conditioning is required.</li>
</ol>
